    "49. How do CNN models handle data with missing or incomplete information?\n",
    "    - Answer: CNN models handle data with missing or incomplete information by learning from the available features and patterns. They can effectively generalize from incomplete data as long as there is enough discriminative information present. Techniques such as dropout or regularization can also help improve model robustness by reducing sensitivity to missing data. Additionally, data imputation techniques can be used to fill in missing values before feeding the data to the CNN model.\n",

    "50. Describe the concept of multi-label classification in CNNs and techniques for solving this task.\n",
    "    - Answer: Multi-label classification in CNNs refers to the task of assigning multiple labels to an input sample. This is different from traditional single-label classification, where each sample is assigned to a single class. Techniques for multi-label classification include using sigmoid activation functions for each class and optimizing binary cross-entropy loss. Thresholding techniques can be applied to interpret the predicted probabilities as class labels. Other approaches include using attention mechanisms, hierarchical classification, or adapting the problem to a sequence labeling task.\n",
